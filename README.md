We have designed an application for a user to be able to search for nearby festivals.  Our application is called Fest Tracker. This application allows the user to search by category and narrow a search using their preferred date, time and location.

**To get started…**  
We have three models for our application. Those models include a consumer, festival, and review class. The classes will relate in a “many too many”  format using Object Relationship methods. We will also use an Active Record method to link the relationship of the models together.

1. The first step is to Fork and Clone the “Final Project Guidelines” from Git Hub., from there we would be able to access and create our application through learn.co.  
2. We would then make sure to create a library folder in the toolbar, from there we could create the correct files for our three models consumer, festival, and review class. We should name the models ( create_consumer.rb, create_festival.rb and create_review.rb).
3. The next step is to modify each model class with the (ActiveMethod :: Base). We also need to add the migrate method for each class.
4. We should create tables for each of the three models. The structure of the tables should include the following.  
    1. Create a file for the create_festival.rb.
    2. Create a file for the create_cosumer.rb.
    3. Create a file for the create_review.rb.

This is what I came up with so far. Let me know how we can add or modify it.
